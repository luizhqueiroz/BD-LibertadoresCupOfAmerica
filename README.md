# Database

## Libertadores Cup Of America 

The project aims to develop a database to store and manage data for the Copa Libertadores, focusing on its structure, teams, matches, and in-game events. The tournament is divided into three phases—preliminary rounds, group stage, and knockout stage—each with designated player registration periods, including start and end dates for team roster submissions.

Each team is defined by its name, country, and city, with the home and away designations for matches specified. Teams consist of players and sponsors, where sponsors have specific placements for logos on team jerseys. Matches are scheduled with dates, matchdays, and are played in stadiums, each with a name, location, and capacity, linking to the teams involved.

For players, relevant details include name, weight, height, jersey number, and jersey name. Players are assigned positions (each with a specific name) for each match and can only be registered to one team at a time.

Additionally, the database will capture in-game events such as player penalties (cards with specified colors), goals scored (including the scoring team), and player substitutions (who was substituted and the replacement), along with the minute each event occurred.
